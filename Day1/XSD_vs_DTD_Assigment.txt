3.XML schemas allow support for namespaces while DTD does not.
4.XML schemas define number and order of child elements, while DTD does not.
5.XML schemas can be manipulated on your own with XML DOM but it is not possible in case of DTD.
6.using XML schema user need not to learn a new language but working with DTD is difficult for a user.
7.XML schema provides secure data communication i.e sender can describe the data in a way that receiver will understand,
 but in case of DTD data can be misunderstood by the receiver.
